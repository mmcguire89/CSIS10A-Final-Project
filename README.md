# CSIS10A-Final-Project-3DRayCaster
Repo for CSIS10A Final Project

## This project will attempt to build a 3D Raycastyer in Java using JavaFX to draw graphics.
  - Step 1: Build a top-down representation of a level using a grid design.
  - Create an array to hold the values of walls vs. empty space.
  - Add an actor to the world and create movement controls.
  - Use trig to create movement rotation - convert 0 - 360 to radians.
  - Cast a ray from the actor and use trigonometry to figure out x,y offset between grid units.
  - Determine how to store where rays intersect with horizontal and vertical lines.
  - Add additional rays to simulate FOV.
  - Convert/draw walls in 3D using JavaFX - hopefully the FPS isn't horrible.
